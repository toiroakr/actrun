# Contributing to actrun

Thank you for your interest in contributing to actrun!

> In this fork, the npm package is `@toiroakr/actrun` and releases go through changesets and npm trusted publishing instead of the `NPM_TOKEN` flow below; see [testdata/fork-features/README.md](testdata/fork-features/README.md). The changesets CLI needs Node.js 22.11+.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [MoonBit](https://docs.moonbitlang.com) toolchain
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) command runner
- Node.js 18+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (for action execution and the npm build)
- Git

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mizchi/actrun.git
cd actrun
just        # check + test
```

## Development Workflow

```bash
just            # check + test
just fmt        # format code
just check      # type check (moon check --deny-warn)
just test       # run tests
just e2e        # run E2E scenarios
just run        # run main
```

### JavaScript / npm Build

The CLI also ships as the `@mizchi/actrun` npm package. Build and smoke test it with:

```bash
just build-js          # moon build (js) + node scripts/bundle-js.js -> dist/actrun.js, lib/actrun.js
node dist/actrun.js --help
just check-js          # moon check --deny-warn --target js
```

`npm run build` runs the same steps and is invoked automatically by `prepublishOnly`.
The release workflow attaches the `npm pack` tarball to the GitHub release and publishes
to npm when the `NPM_TOKEN` secret is configured.

### Before Submitting

Run the full release check to make sure everything passes:

```bash
just release-check  # fmt + info + check + test + e2e
```

## Project Structure

| Directory/File | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `src/lib.mbt` | Contract types |
| `src/parser.mbt` | Workflow YAML parser |
| `src/trigger.mbt` | Push trigger matcher |
| `src/lowering.mbt` | Bitflow IR lowering |
| `src/executor.mbt` | Native host executor |
| `src/runtime.mbt` | Git workspace materialization |

| `testdata/` | Compatibility fixtures |

## Coding Conventions

- MoonBit code uses `snake_case` for variables/functions, `UpperCamelCase` for types and enums
- Each code block is separated by `///|`
- Use `moon doc '<Type>'` to explore APIs before implementing
- Use `moon test --update` to update snapshot tests

## Submitting Issues

We provide issue templates for:

- **Bug Report** - for unexpected behavior or errors
- **Feature Request** - for new features or enhancements

Please use the appropriate template when creating an issue.

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure `just release-check` passes
4. Fill in the PR template with a summary, changes, and test plan
5. Submit the pull request

### Tips

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Include test cases for new functionality
- Update snapshot tests with `just test-update` if needed
- Link related issues in the PR description
