# Changelog

## 0.32.0-fork.3

### Patch Changes

- f65c994: Add opt-in YAML evaluation coverage records. Preserve checkout executable modes, composite sibling outputs and interpolated inputs, event payload fields, and logical expression values. Support runner temporary artifacts with glob and exclusion matching, while rejecting symlinks that escape the temporary directory.
- b485418: `--skip-action` (and `local_skip_actions`) now also skips a matching action used inside a local composite action or a reusable workflow, not only a step of the workflow itself. Such an action is no longer listed in the third-party actions confirmation, fetched, or run, and a local action that matches is not looked into. Each skipped step is shown as a `skip  <job>/<step> / <inner step> (<uses>)` line, like a skipped step of the workflow, once per job of a matrix. Before, a workflow whose composite action used a skipped action still stopped at the `Continue? [y/N]` prompt, and fetched and ran the action once confirmed.

## 0.32.0-fork.2

### Patch Changes

- afc778f: `actrun <arg>` now reports `unknown command: <arg>` with the usage when `<arg>` is not a `.yml` / `.yaml` path, instead of trying to run it as a workflow file. A workflow file that does not exist now fails with `workflow file not found: <path>` before any workspace is created, and a workflow file missing from the worktree/tmp workspace (for example, not committed yet) fails with a hint to commit it or pass `--include-dirty` / `--local`. A workspace is now removed even when the run stops early with an error.
- 6da97c9: Read YAML block scalars with chomping and indentation indicators (`|-`, `>-`, `|+`, `|2-`, ...) in workflows. A key such as `if: |-` no longer drops the keys that follow it (`jobs.<id>.steps is required`) or reads `|-` itself as its value. Block scalar values now end with the line breaks their chomping indicator asks for, so a plain `run: |` script ends with one line break as on GitHub Actions, folded scalars (`>`) fold lines as YAML specifies, and lines starting with `#` inside a block scalar stay in its value instead of becoming empty lines.

## 0.32.0-fork.1

### Patch Changes

- 1a18e0c: Publish from CI with npm trusted publishing for the first time; no package changes.

## 0.32.0-fork.0

First release of the `@toiroakr/actrun` soft fork, based on upstream `0.32.0`.

- Support `uses: $/path` (the self-repository `uses` syntax): it resolves to the repository of the file that contains it, at the running commit, from workflow steps, local composites, fetched composites and remote reusable workflows
- Resolve `inputs.*` in the `if` and `continue-on-error` of composite action steps, and honor `continue-on-error` on composite action steps
- Fix the built-in `setup-node` shim so it runs the host `node` instead of recursing into itself, and skip unsupported `cache` package managers instead of failing
- Report third-party actions nested under local composites and local reusable workflows in the trust prompt
- Ship `scripts/wasi-runner.mjs` in the npm package so the `deno` / `v8` WASM runners can find it

## 0.31.0

### Toolchain

- Support the latest MoonBit toolchain (`moon 0.1.20260915` / `moonc v0.10.13`): `moon check --deny-warn` passes with zero warnings on both the `native` and `js` targets
- Migrate to the new `moon.mod` module format; the Nix build reads its copy from `nix/moon.mod.json`
- Update dependencies: `moonbitlang/async` 0.22, `moonbitlang/x` 0.5, `moonbitlang/quickcheck` 0.14, `moonbit-community/yaml` 0.0.6, `bobzhang/toml` 0.4, `mizchi/jq` 0.2.2, `mizchi/wite` 0.11.3, `mizchi/bit_*` 0.47.0 (0.46.4 does not compile on this toolchain)
- Replace deprecated core APIs (`@strconv.parse_*` → `@string.parse_*`, `@xsys` env helpers → `@env`, `StringBuilder::new()`, `Map::new()`, `{}` map literals, `Char::from_int`, `try?`)

### Changes

- Follow the `mizchi/bit` module split: `mizchi/bit` is now an executable module, so the library imports move to `mizchi/bit_core`, `mizchi/bit_lib`, `mizchi/bit_diff` and `mizchi/bit_osfs` (`materialize_bit_push_workspace` / `compute_bit_changed_paths` keep their behavior; `@bit.materialize_clone_to_fs` gained a `RepoFileSystem` argument)
- Replace the `mizchi/moomaid` renderer used by `actrun viz` with a built-in layered DAG renderer for ASCII and SVG output (`mizchi/moomaid` dropped native support)
- YAML parse errors now report the line and column of the failure

### JS / npm

- Fix the npm build: `scripts/bundle-js.js` is now ESM and injects a `require` shim so the bundled CLI runs under Node.js
- Publish `lib/actrun.js` and `lib/actrun.d.ts` (`planWorkflow`, `planResultToJson`) alongside the CLI; add `just build-js` / `just check-js`

## 0.29.0

### Features

- Add `src/sandbox/` — target-agnostic sandboxed step executor with `trait Fs` for dependency injection
  - `MemFs`: in-memory filesystem implementation for browser / WASM targets
  - `execute_shell_step`: runs shell steps entirely in-memory via injected `&Fs`
  - `parse_key_values`: reads `GITHUB_OUTPUT` / `GITHUB_ENV` from any `&Fs`
  - JS binding example: registers `plan` / `executeShellStep` / `executeWasmStep` on `globalThis._actrun_sandbox`
  - Builds with `--target native/js/wasm/wasm-gc`
- Add `remove` / `mkdir` / `is_dir` to `VirtualFs` for directory semantics

### CI / Tooling

- Update `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/download-artifact` from v4 to v5 in release workflow (Node 20 deprecation fix)

## 0.28.1

### Bug Fixes

- Fix JS-target builds after the WASM sandbox changes so Docker / bundled releases can build again

## 0.28.0

### Features

- Add GitHub-compatible WASM sidecar execution for `node*` actions on self-hosted runners
- Add explicit WASM runtime selection with `--wasm-runner` / `ACTRUN_WASM_RUNNER` (`wasmtime`, `deno`, `v8`)
- Add plan API, in-process shell execution, and MoonBit-generated WASI runner / worker paths
- Add slim container image and compat CI coverage for GitHub-hosted JS fallback and self-hosted WASM execution

### Security

- Harden WASI sandbox path validation and cleanup to prevent traversal and leftover tempdir issues

### CI / Tooling

- Pin the MoonBit toolchain in workflows and replace deprecated setup actions to keep CI reproducible
- Tighten the public API boundary docs and mark protocol extensions such as `wasm://...` and `runs-on: wasi` as internal / experimental

## 0.27.0

### Security

- Fix expression injection via matrix values in `if` conditions — matrix values are now quoted as string literals to prevent injection like `'true' || always()` from bypassing conditionals
- Add path traversal protection for local action references (`uses: ./path`) — reject paths that escape the workspace via `..` segments
- Clean up script files after step execution to avoid leaving interpolated secrets on disk

### Bug Fixes

- **Composite action outputs not propagated** — `steps.<composite-id>.outputs.*` now works correctly for composite actions (#18, reported by @bmthd)
- **Composite action outcome/conclusion not set** — `steps.<composite-id>.outcome` and `steps.<composite-id>.conclusion` are now propagated from inner steps
- **JS SyntaxError on startup** — fix `${}` in MoonBit-generated JS template literals causing `SyntaxError: Missing } in template expression` (#17, reported by @bmthd)
- **Matrix substitution in complex expressions** — `${{ matrix.key != 'true' }}` no longer replaces the entire expression with empty string; matrix refs within larger expressions are now substituted inline while preserving the `${{ }}` wrapper
- **Job-level `if` not matrix-substituted** — `if: ${{ matrix.skip != 'true' }}` at the job level now works correctly

### Tests

- 13 new matrix strategy test fixtures: three axes, job/step if/env/name, continue-on-error, include extra keys, matrix chain, working-directory, unquoted YAML values
- 5 composite action test fixtures: single output, multiple outputs, outcome/conclusion, output in if condition, GITHUB_ENV propagation
- 28 unit tests for `substitute_matrix_text` edge cases (special characters, complex expressions, injection attempts)
- 3 executor tests for output/env with special characters and heredoc format

- Added minimal job-level `if:` support with status functions and simple `github.*` / `needs.*` comparisons, plus docs/E2E coverage for default skip and `if: always()`
- Added minimal step-level `if:` support for `always()` / `failure()` / `cancelled()`, plus docs/E2E coverage for default skip after failure
- Added minimal step-level `continue-on-error` support, preserving failed task outcome while letting later steps run and the workflow stay green
- Added minimal `${{ steps.<id>.outcome }}` / `${{ steps.<id>.conclusion }}` support for later step script/env/if expressions, and upgraded act `steps-context-*` fixtures to supported
- Added minimal builtin `actions/checkout` `fetch-depth` support, plus docs/E2E coverage for shallow default and `fetch-depth: 0`
- Added minimal builtin `actions/checkout` `ref` support, with branch-selection coverage in docs and E2E scenarios
- Added minimal builtin `actions/checkout` `clean` support, preserving untracked files on `clean: false` while keeping default cleanup semantics, plus docs/E2E coverage
- Added minimal builtin `actions/checkout` `submodules` support for `true` and `recursive`, plus docs/E2E coverage for direct vs nested submodule initialization
- Added remote reusable workflow support for `uses: ./.github/actions/*` local actions by rewriting them against the fetched repo root, plus unit and E2E coverage
- Added reusable workflow `secrets: inherit` docs/E2E coverage and a GitHub-hosted compat workflow that compares inherited `GITHUB_TOKEN` presence against the local runner
- Added `gha-compat-compare` to replay dispatchable compat workflows locally and compare downloaded GitHub-hosted artifacts against local emulator output
- Added `gha-compat-live` to dispatch a GitHub-hosted compat workflow, wait for completion, download artifacts, and compare against local emulator output in one step
- Fixed builtin `actions/checkout` sparse-checkout to match default cone-mode semantics on GitHub-hosted runners, and added `sparse-checkout-cone-mode: false` regression coverage
